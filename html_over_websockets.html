<p>
I learned Javascript at the wrong time, just after the release of ES6 with all
the modifications that you know. Similarly, for Express and React, they were
the new technologies to adopt (Javascript everywhere !), but the French job
market was not up to date, and it took some time before React became popular.
So, I put web development and Javascript aside for a while, learning for fun
rather than for work, I wasn't a developer at the time.
</p>

<p>
But now, as a Python and Django developer, I still have front-end needs,
especially for personal projects where I have to fill all roles, from design to
deployment. But I'm feeling frustrated by the need to switch between multiple
programming languages and frameworks in order to create a fully functional web
application, so I became interested in HTML over the wire.

<div id="HTML over the wire with WebSockets, a new approach to SPAs-WebSockets, what and why ?"><h2 id="WebSockets, what and why ?" class="header"><a href="#HTML over the wire with WebSockets, a new approach to SPAs-WebSockets, what and why ?">WebSockets, what and why ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
The WebSocket protocol is built on top of TCP, and uses a handshake process to
establish the connection, followed by a message-based communication protocol.
This allows for bidirectional, low-latency communication between the client and
the server.
</p>

<p>
So with WebSockets, I could write server-side Python code that would send HTML
over the WebSocket connection to be dynamically displayed in the user's
browser. Because logic lives on the server and the browser deals just with the
HTML , I can stick to Python, eliminating the need to learn a separate
front-end framework or language.

<p>
Because of persistent connection between client and server, WebSockets can be
vulnerable to attacks such as denial-of-service, state management can be more
complex than with HTTP requests. Additionally, more server resources are
required to handle many concurrent connections, which can impact scalability.
But i suppose all of this can be handled with proper implementation :P
</p>

<p>
Another drawback is the ecosystem, there's a few comprehensive frameworks,
documentation, and tutorials to aid developers in building and maintaining
WebSocket-based applications.

HTML over the wire can be useful in all sort of real-time applications, for
example :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Chat

<li>
Multiplayer games

<li>
Stock trading platforms

<li>
Collaborative editing tools

<li>
Analytics dashboards
